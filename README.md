# lua-scripts
this repo will be filled with useful lua scripts for the remote lua loader

credit to my team for creating such exploits so i will give a quick overview on whats to come:

# PS5:
  - Kernel r/w scripts for Firmware: 11.xx
  - A bunch of other payloads such as FTP server with full access on non-jailbroken devices
  - A remote pkg installer
  - maybe (we dont know yet) fpkg support for those versions
  - much much more !

# PS4:
  - We have a kinda working Kernel exploit for 12.50 and 12.52 but we stopped working on it.

Current progress:

# PS5:
  - Kernel exploit has a stunning ~15% success rate o_o🟡
  - Working debug settings opener🟡
  - Working Direct PKG installer✅
  - Full access FTP server (on non jailbroken and jailbroken consoles)✅
  - Working Elf loader✅
  - Our goals:
  - Debug trophies support✅
  - never disable screenshot / video support✅
  - FW update block🟡
  - Integrated cheat menus🟡
  - Homebrew enabler (like etaHEN but we need the raw code to work on import and support)🟡?waiting for tests
  - Auto PKG installer for PS5 (goal is to get this to work like the one for PS4)❌
  - other Plugins❌
    
# PS4:
  - Working kernel exploit for 12.50 and 12.52 with success rate of ~20%
  - jup that it ._.
  - Our goals:
  - ye not really anyones cause of lack of knowledge

FOR NOW until december the code will stay private for testing purposes.
WHEN we release this code we first upload the found exploit to the hackerone bug bounty programm of Playstation.
This means if you want a Kernel exploit to work on those firmwares, THEN DO NOT UPDATE!!!

With the release we will also add credit to the code pieces we used.
